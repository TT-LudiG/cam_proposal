<h2 id="systemoverview">System Overview</h2>

<p>The system will comprise of simple IP cameras installed on locations with native internet access, likely residential properties, and connected to the on-site internal network via ethernet cables. A pre-programmed, compact computer will be installed on-site, alongside the cameras, for the purpose of reading the video feed from the cameras and running an image-recognition algorithm to identify frames that contain persons and/or cars, and send these frames via the on-site internet to a remote server. This computer will also be connected to the internal on-site network via an Ethernet cable.
The remote server will collect all sent image frames (containing persons and/or vehicles) and store them. The server will then generate an alert message in an appropriate form (instant messenger, SMS, email, etc.) corresponding to the received frame, and send it to the appropriate recipients.</p>

<p><a name="hardware_requirements"></a></p>

<h2 id="hardwarerequirements">Hardware Requirements</h2>

<p>The system will require the following pieces of hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>On-site:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Simple IP cameras supporting PoE and infrared nightvision (meaning no unnecessary onboard intelligence and able to supply power via the Ethernet cable, one-to-many per installation site)</li>
<li>Compact, cheap computer running a Unix-based operating system (for running the intelligence required to be local to the cameras, including image recognition, only one per installation site)</li>
<li>Ethernet cables (one per camera, one for the computer, one for an Ethernet switch, length to be determined during installation)</li>
<li>Ethernet switch supporting PoE (for connecting the Ethernet cables to the on-site router and supplying power via those cables, requiring only one free Ethernet port on the router)</li>
<li>Metal pole/fixture, coated with anti-rust spray/paint (for fixing the cameras in position, likely one per camera, depending on the installation site)</li>
<li>PVC pipes (for protecting Ethernet cables laid on-site that are exposed to the elements, or underground, to be determined during installation)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Remote:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Server machine, with data storage capacity (for receiving image frames sent by the on-site computers, storing them, generating alerts, facilitating debugging and maintenance and providing the opportunity for functionality expansion; can be accomplished with a virtual machine)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="hardware_recommendations"></a></p>

<h2 id="hardwarerecommendations">Hardware Recommendations</h2>

<p>The following devices are recommended as viable solutions to the hardware requirements outlined above, with motivation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>On-site:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simple IP cameras supporting PoE:</strong> Hikvision AcuSense 4MP Bullet Cameras, of appropriate focal length. Reliable, accessable and affordable, if you forgo the more extravagant models that come bundled with intelligent features, such as image recognition (unnecessary in our case, our intelligence will be provided by the on-site computer).</li>
<li><strong>Compact, cheap computer running a Unix-based operating system:</strong> The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is reliable, accessable and affordable.

<p><a name="sd_physical_layout"></a></p>

<h3 id="physicallayout">Physical Layout</h3>

<p>The following diagram is intended to provide a look as to what the physical infrastructure, that is to be installed at each site, will look like:</p>

<strong>Solid lines between items represent physical Ethernet cables, whereas dotted lines represent internet connections of unspecified nature.</strong></p>

<p><a name="sd_extensibility"></a></p>

<h3 id="extensiblity">Extensiblity</h3>

<p>The system design, as described in previous sections, lends itself well to extension and expansion. Additional cameras can be added by simply plugging them into the installed Ethernet switch. Specialised types of cameras, such as cameras that can reliably discern and detect license plate values on cars, can be added in a similar fashion, with updates to the local Pis being, at most, as complicated as simply swapping out the existing SD cards for updated ones that support the new functionality.
A VPN can be established via the remote server that can expedite the update process, providing remote access to the Pis that circumvent the requirement for physical access to the machines in order to perform both updates and maintenance/debugging, should the need arise. Said VPN could be extended to provide remote access to the on-site cameras as well by routing via the Pi, sidestepping the requirement to log into the on-site router in order to open ports on the outside for purposes of exposing the cameras to remote login, again simplifying updating, debugging and other potential maintenance tasks.
The remote server provides a platform to host potential data-dependant solutions that might be of interest to clients, from simple solutions that expose the collected data on the server to a client via easy-to-use web interfaces, to complex solutions that interpret the data in meaningful ways to provide clients with useful information regarding observed patterns of human and motor-vehicle movement caught on camera. The scalability of virtual machines ensures that additional server functionality will always be possible, provided the additional cost is acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="sd_scalability"></a></p>

<h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>

<p>The system design is also well-suited for scaling with additional cameras being installed and additional properties being included into the system. All intensive machine learning work is performed locally per-site, so as long as the number of cameras per each individual site (a site being defined as containing a single Pi) is kept relatively low, new sites with new cameras can be added to the system without any noticeable performance overhead on the remote server, or the system itself.
The number of cameras possible on a single site with a single Pi are restricted only by the performance of the Pi in running the image recognition algorithm. The networking overhead of adding additional cameras is negligible, since the Pi filters out all irrelevant image frames and only frames that contain people or cars are sent over the internet to the remote server. Thus, performance of the on-site internet connection should mostly unaffected by the inclusion of the system&#8217;s traffic, regardless of how many cameras are added on the site.</p>

<p><a name="sd_concerns"></a></p>

<h3 id="concerns">Concerns</h3>

<p>The concerns addressed here are not so much concerns about the core system design, as they are concerns about some of the functionality one might feasibly choose to add to the system. By default, the system only runs image recognition with the intent to discern human figures and cars that appear in the video feed from the cameras, and does not attempt facial recognition or license plate recognition for vehicles. There are 2 reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>License plate recognition requires a particular type of camera that is more costly, cannot reliably discern human from car (thus necessitating a camera that can) and have difficulty operating in the dark (due to the manner in which infrared light reacts to the plates). Cameras that can perform facial recognition are not nearly as particular, however they still have higher resolution requirements than cameras that only need discern humans from cars and may require camera focal lengths that are not optimal for that task.</p></li>
<li><p>More significantly, the utility of identifying and recording faces and license plates out in public space is situational: Identifying people and cars that pass by a house, or on a street, will likely not assist in you dealing with the police should a burglary/theft occur and the perpetrators escape, unless the footage that indentifies the guilty persons also shows clearly their involvement with the act in question. Or, simply put, correlation does not equal causation in the eyes of the law, and the primary utility of cameras that identify individuals would be to ensure that those individuals are caught by the police and, potentially, to allow the recovery of stolen goods. They provide reactive capability after a crime is committed, as opposed to the proactive capability of cameras that send alerts when any human or vehicle is detected in a certain vicinity, ideally allowing for appropriate response to either interrupt the crime in progress, or prevent it from happening at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, there is an advantage in building a database of faces and license plates that pass through your area: The data can either be parsed by specialised pattern-recognition algorithms, or simply exposed to clients via a web interface, in order to provide information to said clients that they might deem valuable. As long as these databases remain private, no legal trouble would be warranted. License plates could be checked against other privately-owned databases to attempt to identify owners, if access to such databases could be acquired. Ultimately, it is up to the client to decide whether or not facial and/or license plate recognition would be worth the additional cost, time and effort.</p>

<p><a name="estimated_hardware_costs"></a></p>

<h2 id="estimatedhardwarecosts">Estimated Hardware Costs</h2>

<p>The following table provides a cost estimate for each of the most significant hardware items:</p>

<p>The average site setup would include:</p>

<li>2 x Hikvision cameras @ <strong>approx. R1950 each</strong></li>
<li>1 x Raspberry Pi @ <strong>approx. R950</strong></li>
<li>1 x PoE Switch @ <strong>approx. R700</strong></li>
<li>1 x MicroSD Card @ <strong>approx. R120</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Which would total <strong>R5670</strong> per site, plus <strong>approx. R200-R300</strong> for all supplementary material, and not including the installation fee.</p>
